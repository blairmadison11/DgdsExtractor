ONE DOZEN ROSES:
Organically grown roses.  Just the thing to get a guy out of hot water with his girlfriend.

DRUG PATCH:
Once used exclusively by the professional health care establishment for administering prescribed medications, these devices have found their way into the hands of big-time drug dealers.  Often placed on the neck over the carotid artery, they are typically used to administer drugs transdermally in a measured dosage.

PLEASURE DOME CLAIM TICKET:
This enables the bearer to claim his or her weapons upon exiting the pleasuredome.

CHANDRA'S PHOTO:
?Picture of the Mayor's daughter.

APPD:

This product was developed with the idea of providing "A safe and humane way of disabling an assailant."  Theoretically, it is supposed to induce a state of extreme euphoria which renders the target incapable of any hostile actions.

SCREW DRIVER:
Sears CraftsPerson phillips-head screwdriver.

WIRES FROM CLOSET:
These wires look like they could hold a lot of voltage.  They might be usefull if I need to disable some electrical device.

FORTUNE COOKIE:
This stale fortune cookie has an unusual fortune... It says:

"RYP YWP YRPWRY PBW".

I probably shouldn't use this medical kit until I have some injuries.

Ahhh, that's better.

MAYOR VINCENZI:
Not that I'd call any of the slime that hangs out there a "friend"!

MAYOR VINCENZI:
I'm sending you a vid-transmission hardcopy of my daughter...

MAYOR VINCENZI:
after she was found.

MAYOR VINCENZI:
It's not pretty, but you might need it.

MAYOR VINCENZI:
I don't need to remind you that this investigation is strictly unofficial. I don't want a word of this to leak to the press.

MAYOR VINCENZI:
You've got to find out what's causing this! I suggest that you start at the Pleasure Dome.

KARYN:
Blade, where the hell were you last night?

KARYN:
We did have a date!

KARYN:

William Hunter, this is your adversary.

DENG HWANG:
I have a friend of yours with me... I believe that she may, in fact, be somewhat more than a friend.  In any case, Karyn Sommers is in my custody.

DENG HWANG:
She is in good health for the moment and, provided you cooperate, there is every reason to expect that she will stay that way.

DENG HWANG:
You have caused us a slight inconvenience, nothing more.  However, you must cease meddling in affairs that are no concern of yours.

DENG HWANG:
Further resistance on your part is futile, Mr. Hunter.  You cannot win, and you will only bring destruction on yourself and those you care about.

DENG HWANG:
Consider my words carefully.  You will not receive another warning.  Good day.

THE JAKE:
Word on the street is that some very lethal dudes are stalkin' a P.I. who's been nosin' around too much!

DENG HWANG:
Hello again, Brother.

DENG HWANG:
I have just learned that our downtown warehouse was destroyed by the former police officer William Hunter.

DENG HWANG:
Your security precautions were clearly inadequate, Brother.

DENG HWANG:
Please come to our factory headquarters on the northern outskirts of the city to discuss this matter immediately.

It's probably not a good idea for me to be waving a gun around here!

I could get in serious trouble if I pull my gun out in here!

A gun isn't going to do me any good here!

I'd better put that can of NaPent away while I'm on the street!

I don't think I should try to use NaPent on anything here!

NaPent isn't going to do me any good here!

Nice piece... Be a pity to lose it!  You got anything else for us?

SLEN:
Your piece!  I won't ask nice again!

BLADE:

SLEN:
Wiseass!  Get inside before I decide to kick your ugly butt from here to the toxic waste dump!

SLEN:
You got yourself a very unhealthy attitude, friend!

BLADE:
1. Alright!  You boys have no sense of humor.

2. Yeah, yeah... here you go.

3. You have got one major attitude problem!

SLEN:
Have a nice time... friend.

SLEN:
Thanks for your cooperation.  That all you got for us?

SLEN:
Your DNA mutated or are you just naturally stupid?

SLEN:
Bad call... friend!

SLEN:
Smart move... have a good time.

SLEN:
With an attitude like yours, I'll be surprised if you make it out in one piece!

SLEN:
Now get inside before I change my mind!

BLADE:
1. So I've heard...

2. Yeah?  Well, it could be the steroid-enhanced company!

3. Yeah, yeah... save me the speech, will ya?

SLEN:
You're clear to go on in, but I'd watch your mouth in there if I were you!

SLEN:
Oh... Very bad choice of words.  You just bought yourself some personal attention!

SLEN:
Look, friend!  You're really starting to piss my partner off!

SLEN:
Now one last time... you want in or not?!!

BLADE:
1. That's it.

2. You wanna frisk me?

3. What do you think?  I'm carrying a kilo of neural gas?

SLEN:
Have a good time.

SLEN:
You're all the same, aren't you?  Get your smart ass inside before I change my mind!

SLEN:
I think I'm tired of seeing your ugly face!

BLADE:
1. Mother always said that I was special.  Here's my piece.

2. Wow!  DNA mutation... You pick that up at the steroid clinic?

3. Why don't you and Fido there go find a bone to chew?!

SLEN:
Yeah, I'm sure she did.  You got anything else for us?

SLEN:
You just bought yourself some trouble, wiseass!

ARREIS:
Bad call, mister!

Say hello to the Maker, slimeoid!

SLEN:
Chocolate!  The wife will love this...

SLEN:
You know the routine...

SLEN:
You gotta check your weapons.

SLEN:
Here's your ticket... go on in.

BLADE:
'Scuse me.  I'd like to get my guns back.

SLEN:
You got a gun check ticket?

BLADE:
What are you talking about?

SLEN:
When you turn in your weapons, you're supposed to get a claim check.

BLADE:
You guys must've forgotten to give me one.

SLEN:
Sorry, buddy.  No claim check, no gun!

BLADE:
But I just gave my gun to you a few minutes ago!

SLEN:
Lotta people come through this door, mister.

SLEN:
You recognize him, Arreis?

ARREIS:
Nope.

SLEN:
Well then I guess you're outta luck, buddy.

BLADE:
1.  Like hell!  You give me my gun or there's gonna be trouble!

2.  Maybe we can work out a deal.

3.  Damn!  I guess I am.

SLEN:
You want trouble buddy?  You got it!

SLEN:
Let's teach this piece of trash a lesson, Arreis!

SLEN:
OK, here's the deal:  Leave now and I won't break both your legs.

SLEN:
Hold on a second while we scan you.

You wanna find somebody, why don't you hire a private dick?!

Very funny.  Have you seen The Jake or not?

2.  Have you ever seen a girl in here named Chandra?

3.  You have quite a card game going here.

FU BAR:
Hurry up and discard, Darce!

DARCELLE:
Shush, Fu.  You're being rude.

DARCELLE:
I'm sorry. I haven't seen that person, William.

DARCELLE:
Why don't you try the bar?

DARCELLE:
Perhaps there is someone who can help you there.

BLADE:
Playin' cards, I see.

BLADE:
Need a fourth?

DARCELLE:
That depends.  We have a fairly high minimum table stake.

BLADE:
Big deal.  What is it? A hundred?

I'm afraid not.  It's one thousand, minimum.

BLADE:
Wow!  Too rich for my blood!

I'm sorry to hear that.

3. I'm looking for "The Jake".

Yo, kissup,
what you want?

BLADE:
1. I'm looking for "The Jake".

2. Who you calling kissup, slosh brain?

3. I'm investigating a murder.  I'd like to ask you a few questions.

Hey, uptown, your attitude leaves a lot to be desired.  Think you'd better pound some other beat!

You a slicker?  I don't hang with no slickers.  Take a hike.

BLADE:
1. Look, you little pisshead!  I've had a bad morning, and I'm not likely to take any crap from a gutter-crawling scum like you!  Now... you know where I can find this guy called "The Jake"?

2. A friend of his is in some trouble.

3. Ease up, buddy! I'm just looking for some information.

Information!  You got some "hardware" to cover such requests?

One of his friends!

THE JAKE:
Yeah, well you got locks on him.  Now who's the friend?

Chandi?  What about her?

What the hell are you talking about, pal?

Later on, bud! You're too tense for me!

Bullshit, man!  Get outta my face!

Chandi... ??

Unless you got proof, get outta my face!

I don't like the way this little chat is going... I think you can find the way out.

Yeah?  What about her?

Ha!  Chandi's always in trouble!  What about her?

My, my!  Black market chocolate... very interesting and very nice!

Oh, my God... Chandi...

I said get lost!

THE JAKE:
In my office!

You must have a hearing problem... I said get outta my face!

THE JAKE:
Let's go someplace where we can talk.

CANDI:
Hello there, handsome! I'm Candi!

CANDI:
Looking for a good time, big guy?

CANDI:
How about you and me getting out of here and into a place a little more "intimate"?

CANDI:
You're not very nice...

CANDI:
What a coincidence! I'm here on business too!

CANDI:
And it looks like business is picking up!

BLADE:
Not monkey business. I mean serious business!

CANDI:
I'm totally serious.  And I mean business!

CANDI:
Why don't you come home with me?

CANDI:
I won't tell her if you won't!

BLADE:
Thanks, but no thanks.

CANDI:
Goodbye!

CANDI:
My, my!  What a wit you are, Blade!

CANDI:
Shall we go, then...?

CANDI:
I've never heard of him...

CANDI:
Maybe you should ask Mujalambo. He knows everyone who comes in here.

BLADE:
 Mujalambo?

CANDI:
The bartender, silly!

CANDI:
Now run along.  You're monopolizing the merchandise, if you know what I mean!

CANDI:
Oh, well. It was nice to meet you!

CANDI:
Have a nice life!

CANDI:
So why don't you just take your cloud of doom and blow away!

BLADE:
The name's William Hunter...

BLADE:
but people call me "Blade".

CANDI:
Well, "Blade", is that a knife in your pocket or are you just glad to meet me?

BLADE:
Er... Uh...

CANDI:
I thought so!

CANDI:
What do you say we split this scene?

CANDI:
You are such an ASS!!

CANDI:
Hello again, Blade! Where's the girlfriend?

BLADE:
She broke up with me!

CANDI:
Sorry to hear that, but you shouldn't cheat on people!

CANDI:
It's not nice and it indicates a real weakness of character!

CANDI:
Now go away!  I don't think I like you anymore.

CANDI:
You're wasting your time, Blade.

CANDI:
You had your chance, and you blew it.

CANDI:
Now go away and quit pestering me!

Greetings, officer.

BLADE:
I'm not a police officer.

Oh. Sorry, dude.  No offense.

BLADE:
I'm a private investigator.  And the name's not "dude". It's Blade.

Sorry, dude... I mean, Blade.

BLADE:
1. I'm looking for some information.

2. Do you know where a guy can go for a good time?

3. You look kinda funny.

BLADE:
1. Ever seen a girl in here named Chandra?

2. I'm looking for a man who calls himself "The Jake."  Ever heard of him?

3. I hear there's a lot of dealing that goes on in here.  Know where I can find a good dose?

BLADE:
1. Ever seen a girl in here named Chandra?

2. Never mind!  I can see I'm talking to a total veg-head.

3. I hear there's a lot of dealing that goes on in here.  Know where I can find a good high?

CASEY JONES:
Last time I saw her, she was with The Jake.  That was awhile ago, though.

BLADE:
You know where I can find him?

BLADE:
Thanks for the info.

CASEY JONES:
Who you callin' veg-head, slag-brain?!

CASEY JONES:
Your attitude sucks, man.  Get lost!

CASEY JONES:
Oh yeah, now I remember... you mean Chandra!

CASEY JONES:
Hello again, officer!

BLADE:
I told you before, I'm not a police officer!

CASEY JONES:
Sorry, dude. I forgot!

BLADE:
Would you quit calling me that?!

CASEY JONES:
Sorry, man.

CASEY JONES:
Every wakin' minute o' the day!

CASEY JONES:
Sail-ing a-waaay in my beau-ti-ful bal-loooon...

This is pointless...

CASEY JONES:
Party on, dude!

CASEY JONES:
I better start hoofin' around, then.  So long!

Can't help you there.

CASEY JONES:
Dude, don't abstract me!  I'm tryin' to expand my consciousness!

Mebbe I have, an mebbe I haven't.  What's it to ya?

MUJALAMBO:

MUJALAMBO:
I don' think he'll care to listen to anythin' ya tell him...

But if ya wanta find him, ask the guy in th' green coat at th' end o' me bar.

MUJALAMBO:
Are ya deaf or jus' stupid?!  I ain't servin' th' likes o' you!

Listen, uptown! If you don't have proof, get outta my face!

Listen, uptown! Unless you got somethin' for me, get outta my face!

Listen, slicker, I don't wanna talk to you no more.  You ask too many of the wrong questions!

THE JAKE:
Hey, slicker...

THE JAKE:
Looks like you were on the up!  Word just hit the streets about Chandi...

THE JAKE:
I seen a photo of her body... God!  What would do that to a person?!

THE JAKE:

THE JAKE:
Leave me alone, slicker...

THE JAKE:
I don't wanna talk right now.

THE JAKE:
Can't you catch a clue, Hunter?

THE JAKE:
I want to be alone now!

THE JAKE:
I told you to get lost!

THE JAKE:
Try back later when my mood might be a little improved!

THE JAKE:
I thought you'd be back...

2.  Look, you little gutter scum! I want information about CHEN!!

3.  The hell we don't! In your booth...NOW!!

Hunter, there ain't nothin' left to say! Why don't you just haul your butt outta here?

THE JAKE:
Alright! Alright....

THE JAKE:
Let's talk in private...

THE JAKE:
Alright, alright! Get all static ridden, why don't ya!

BLADE:
1.  Look, gutter slime! I'm not in the mood for your crap!

2.  Sorry... it's been a lousy day... I just want to find out what happened to your friend.

3.  Do we have to go through this again?

THE JAKE:
I see your manners haven't improved much since our last visit!

THE JAKE:
Why don't we save this special little conversation for another time?!

THE JAKE:
Hey bud! YOU'RE the one who keeps comin' 'round here disruptin' my busy schedule!

THE JAKE:
Why don't you come back when you have a REAL attitude?!

BLADE:
1.  Kid, you got yourself a very unhealthy attitude!

2.  Come on! I just want to talk a little business!

3.  Sure... I'll leave you alone... I'll be sure to tell Chandra's parents what good friends she had.

THE JAKE:
Hunter, just get outta my face!

THE JAKE:
You been nothin' but trouble! Comin' in here, harassin' me...

THE JAKE:
Business, as in financial funding?

THE JAKE:

THE JAKE:
Why you wanna keep pokin' your nose into somethin' that's gonna bite you in the face?

THE JAKE:
Yeah, you do that.

BLADE:
1.  Hey! You ain't seen harassment yet!

2.  Come on, kid... I just want to find out what happened to your friend.

3.  Listen, Jake! Whatever killed your friend is still out there...

THE JAKE:
Yeah?

THE JAKE:
I think our conversation has once again come to a conclusion.

THE JAKE:
Why don't you come back when you have a REAL attitude?!

THE JAKE:
Yeah...

Alright, let's talk...

THE JAKE:

BLADE:
1.  Yeah... I've had a few women tell me the same thing.

2.  Always fancied myself the "Mo" of private investigators.

3.  Nothing funny about what happened to your friend!

THE JAKE:
Yeah, right.

THE JAKE:
I really believe that YOU have trouble with women!

THE JAKE:
You would've liked Chandi... she made me laugh...

THE JAKE:
Alright... let's talk in my office.

THE JAKE:
The one stooge!

THE JAKE:
Man, you're alright... y'know, Chandi would've liked you...

THE JAKE:
She could make me laugh and laugh...

THE JAKE:
I'm really gonna miss her.

THE JAKE:
Come on, let's talk in private.

THE JAKE:
You don't beat around a point, do you, Hunter?

THE JAKE:
No, there's nothing funny about what happened to Chandi...

THE JAKE:
Come on, let's talk in private.

THE JAKE:
You back again?

THE JAKE:
Don't you get the clue?  I don't wanna talk to you!

BLADE:
1.  Yeah?  Well I'm not really thrilled about having to talk to you either!

2.  We don't help each other out, Chandi's murderer will never be found!

3.  I'm tired of playing with you!  Now WHO IS CHEN!??

THE JAKE:
You gotta point?

THE JAKE:
Or do you just like the sound of your own voice?

THE JAKE:
Why you wanna keep pokin' your nose in where it's sure to get bitten off?

THE JAKE:
Quiet!!

THE JAKE:
He's got ears everywhere!

THE JAKE:
Jeez, you get excited easy, mister...

THE JAKE:
Come on, let's talk in private.

BLADE:
1.  The point is, your friend is dead and we're no closer to finding out who did it.

2.  You make a joke out of everything?

3.  I wanna find your friend's killer...

THE JAKE:
Alright, let's talk...

THE JAKE:
no...

THE JAKE:
not everything.

THE JAKE:
You wanna talk?  Let's step into my booth.

THE JAKE:
Alright... alright...

THE JAKE:
Let's step into my office where it's a bit more private...

THE JAKE:
He's got people everywhere.

BLADE:
1.  'Cause I hate murder...  makes my stomach turn!

2.  'Cause I can't just hide my head in the sand whenever trouble comes along!

3.  That's just the kinda guy I am.

THE JAKE:
Yeah. Mine too...

THE JAKE:
Why don't we step into my office?

THE JAKE:
You sayin' I do?

THE JAKE:
Yes... guess I do...

THE JAKE:
Alright, Hunter, you just bought yourself some information...

THE JAKE:
You're a funny guy, Hunter.

THE JAKE:
I think you missed your calling...

THE JAKE:
OK, you wanna talk?  Let's step into my office...

THE JAKE:
Yo! Hunter!

Remember, bub! You didn't hear nothin' from The Jake!

THE JAKE:
Yeah, yeah... save your flattery.

THE JAKE:
You really wanna help, you'll just leave me alone...

BLADE:
1.  Anything else?                                   

2.  Didn't hear a thing.                             

3.  You be around if I find out anything?

BLADE:
1.  Alright, alright! You get anything, give me a call.

2.  You are a pathetic excuse for a friend!               

3.  Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

THE JAKE:
Bub, you are truly unreal! You want my head to end up in a wonton factory?

THE JAKE:
Alright! Check out 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
And Hunter! She was a nice kid...

THE JAKE:

THE JAKE:
Damn, I'm gonna regret this...

THE JAKE:
Check out a 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
That's the pad of a big-time pumper named Chen. You might find something there.

THE JAKE:
Chandi didn't deserve this...

THE JAKE:
She was a good kid!

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you need me!

THE JAKE:
Yeah, I know...

THE JAKE:
now leave me alone!

THE JAKE:
Man, you have to ask that, then you're dumber than you look!

BLADE:
1.  Look, you waste-oid! You think Chandra just bubbled into the pavement 'cause she had nothin' better to do?

2.  Maybe, but I wasn't the one who got 'er brains melted into the pavement.

3.  This guy that big?

THE JAKE:
Don't crash on me, slicker...

THE JAKE:
She was a big girl. She knew what she was doin'...

THE JAKE:
she was just stubborn...

THE JAKE:
I should'a never introduced her to Chen.

THE JAKE:
Get the hell outta my face!

THE JAKE:
This interview just powered down!

THE JAKE:
Bro, these walls have ears...

THE JAKE:
One word from Chen and I'm pushin' up waste barrels in some radiation dump!

BLADE:
1. You got an address you can share?

2. Who's this "Chen" pal of yours?        

3. You're a friggin' little coward!

THE JAKE:
You are amazing!

THE JAKE:
You don't get it, do you?! These people would flick your restart switch in a second!

THE JAKE:
Looks like Chandi found that out the hard way!

THE JAKE:
She was top quality. Never hurt anyone in her life...

THE JAKE:
Alright! You want info, you got it!

THE JAKE:
Just remember, you never heard it from The Jake!

THE JAKE:
Check out 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
And if you find who done this to her... to my Chandi... you smoke 'em hard!

THE JAKE:
Real hard, like they did to her!

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you need me.

BLADE:
1.  O.K., I get the message!          

2.  You're a friggin' little coward!

3.  I won't say a word.

THE JAKE:
Wait!

THE JAKE:
Dammit, I'm gonna regret this...

THE JAKE:
You never heard this from The Jake! You got that?

THE JAKE:
You're lookin' for a guy named Chen.

2.  How was Chandra mixed up with this guy?                          

3.  You think Chandra would want you covering this guy's ass?

THE JAKE:
The hell I am!

THE JAKE:
Why don't you just back off?!

BLADE:
1.  Why don't you show a little backbone?

2.  OK! OK! Sorry!                                     

3.  Why am I wasting my time with you?

THE JAKE:
Hey! I got a backbone!

THE JAKE:
And I want to keep it that way!

THE JAKE:
This meeting is adjourned!

THE JAKE:
Hell if I know! Not like I'm enjoying our little convo!

BLADE:
1.  You gonna help me find Chandra's killer or not?

2.  It's been real nice!

3.  You think Chandra enjoyed what happened to her?

THE JAKE:
Look, you wanna play private dick? Fine with me!

THE JAKE:
Check out 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:

THE JAKE:
Alright, alright...

THE JAKE:
One more thing...

THE JAKE:
if you find he's the one... I want him hurt! Hurt bad...

THE JAKE:

THE JAKE:
You owe me that much!

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you find anything out.

THE JAKE:
I told you! I don't know what you're talking about!

BLADE:
1.  She was your friend, wasn't she?

2.  I'm talkin' about your dead friend and some guy named Chen.

3.  I'll bet your melted friend Chandra would know what I'm talkin' about!

THE JAKE:
Yeah, she was my friend!

THE JAKE:
Does that mean I gotta get my lungs scooped out for her?

THE JAKE:
You'll get us both cancelled!

THE JAKE:
I'll tell you...

THE JAKE:
his name is Chen. He's in with some Chinatown hit group. Chandi wanted to try some of his goods.

THE JAKE:
Damn stupid girl! I told her not to mess with him! She just wouldn't listen!

THE JAKE:
Wanted to go and drug up her problems...

THE JAKE:
That's it! You're outta here!

THE JAKE:
She was never no harm to nobody! You got no right talkin' about her like that!

BLADE:
1.  WHO THE HELL IS "CHEN"?!!                 

2.  You're some friend!                            

3.  How about I scoop 'em out for you?!!

THE JAKE:
I tried to protect her...

THE JAKE:
she was just too snoopy... wantin' to try everything.

THE JAKE:
Look. You never heard this from The Jake! You got that?

3.  I don't know... but someone does! Why don't you help me out?

THE JAKE:
So!

THE JAKE:
What you want me doin' 'bout it?

THE JAKE:
The folks she was mixed up with, they deal some serious drugs...

THE JAKE:
I leak one word and they'll wipe me without a thought!

THE JAKE:
I got no more friends...

THE JAKE:
'Cause I'm a coward.

THE JAKE:
Look, you think I WANTED this to happen?

THE JAKE:
She was my only friend.

BLADE:
1.  That all you care about? Yourself?

2.  You don't tell me what I want to know, and I might just beat them to it!

3.  She was your friend.

THE JAKE:
Look, you got no right talkin' to me like that!

THE JAKE:
This conversation is at an end!

THE JAKE:
Oooh! Big slicker!

THE JAKE:
You really scare me!

Why don't you find someone else to harass?

THE JAKE:
Chandi was hangin' 'round with him and his group.

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you find anything out.

THE JAKE:
Prob'ly not...

THE JAKE:
I think we've finished this little conversation, Hunter.

THE JAKE:
Let me know, you find anything out.

THE JAKE:
Yeah...

THE JAKE:
You know, I'm gonna really miss her...

THE JAKE:
I TOLD her! Don't mess with that crap!! Damn stupid girl...

THE JAKE:
He's got a place over at 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
That's all I know.

THE JAKE:
Chandi was hangin' 'round with him and his group.

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you find anything out.

BLADE:
1.  You have any idea what could have done this to her?

2.  What was she mixed up with? Prostitution? Drugs?  

3.  I thought you were supposed to be her friend!

THE JAKE:
How the hell should I know!?

THE JAKE:
You listen to the China Tombstoners, and those old folks'll tell you the world is comin' to an end.

THE JAKE:
They been talkin' it up lately about "unnatural" deaths and the return of the "Ancient One".

THE JAKE:
A lot of B.S., but...

THE JAKE:
makes more sense than anything I could tell ya...

THE JAKE:
Get this straight, uptown! Chandi weren't no hooker!

THE JAKE:
She had more class than all of us in this place put together...

THE JAKE:
she didn't deserve this!

BLADE:
1.  You got an address you can share?

2.  Look, all I want to do is help! Who was she mixed up with?

3.  Look, you waste-oid! You think Chandra just bubbled into the pavement because she had nothing better to do?

THE JAKE:
Yeah? Well maybe she didn't have the best taste in company!

THE JAKE:
I gotta go.

BLADE:
1.  You're right. Sounds like B.S.      

2.  I don't believe in that crap. Why don't you just tell me what you know?

3.  TELL ME WHERE TO FIND CHEN!!

THE JAKE:
Told you it did!

THE JAKE:
I hear that they got some old folks over there, say they seen this before, in the old country.

THE JAKE:
Strange stuff...

THE JAKE:
The skies turnin' to blood, the rivers boilin', dogs and cats livin' together...

BLADE:
1.  Yeah, yeah... real funny. You think we got Gozer the Traveler runnin' 'round meltin' people?

2.  Cut the crap and just let me know who this "Chen" character is!

3.  Sound like a bad movie!

THE JAKE:
Who knows...?

THE JAKE:
Look, Hunter, I don't want to get cancelled, so you better keep this confidential!

THE JAKE:
Chandi was hangin' with a guy named Chen. He's some big-timer from a group over in Chinatown.

THE JAKE:
The guy's BAAAD...!

THE JAKE:
He's got a place at 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
Watch your butt, Hunter! These are the "bad guys" your mother warned you about!

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you need anything else.

THE JAKE:
Yeah... it gets worse! I hear that they think some kind of demonic dragon is roamin' the street, waitin' to suck the life outta people!

THE JAKE:
Very weird effin' stuff!

THE JAKE:
Chandi would have loved it.

THE JAKE:
Alright Hunter... I'll help you!

THE JAKE:
Go to 544 Wallaby Street, #798. That's were Chen lives.

THE JAKE:
Chandi was messin' 'round with him and his druggy pals.

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you need me.

THE JAKE:
I told her!

THE JAKE:
Told her he was nothin' but bad news!

THE JAKE:
Why didn't she LISTEN to me!!

THE JAKE:
Stupid! She was effin' stupid!!

THE JAKE:
Chandi...

THE JAKE:
I told her he was bad news...

THE JAKE:
told her... stay away from Chen, and...

MASTER CONTROL:
1.  First Encounter
2.  Second Encounter, but message not received.
3.  Message received
4.  Restart
5.  CANCEL

THE JAKE:
You never heard this from The Jake!

THE JAKE:
You got that, Hunter?

THE JAKE:
Chandi was mixed up with a big-time pumper named Chen Lu. He's got a place over on 554 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
You know, I told her he was bad news... Damn girl just wouldn't listen.

THE JAKE:
I just want one thing, Hunter. If you find out that Lu was behind Chandi's death, I want you to flatline him for me...

THE JAKE:
Flatline him! Hard n' ugly!

THE JAKE:
I'll be around, you get anything.

THE JAKE:
Chandi was mixed up with a guy named Chen Lu.

THE JAKE:
You gotta swear you'll never say where you heard this!

THE JAKE:
These folks are major bad news! I'm talkin' BAAAD people!

THE JAKE:
I TOLD Chandi that! She just wouldn't listen!

THE JAKE:
She wanted to bury her problems in drugs...

THE JAKE:
Chen Lu was happy to help out.

THE JAKE:
He holds a place at 544 Wallaby Street, #798.

THE JAKE:
Check it out... but watch yourself!

THE JAKE:
He's not a nice man!

THE JAKE:
I'll be hangin' 'round, you need anything else.

THE JAKE:
Get outta my face now!  I don't want people seeing me talkin' to a slicker like you!

THE JAKE:
Don't you hear well?  I can't talk to you anymore!

THE JAKE:
Get lost! You're gonna get us both wasted!

JENNI:
Hi, Blade.  Want to play house?

JENNI:
The mayor is in a meeting and can't be disturbed.

JENNI:
Is there anything that I can do for you personally, ya big stud...?

JENNI:
I mean as long as it's nothing kinky...

JENNI:
Not that kinky is all bad...

JENNI:
What are you wasting your time on that little bimbo for?

JENNI:
What YOU need, Blade, is a REAL woman...

JENNI:
like me, for instance!

JENNI:
One who could take you places you never dreamed possible...

JENNI:
A little dancing, a little moonlight, a little romance...

JENNI:
you know...

BLADE:
1.   I'm flattered, but I'm a one girl kind of guy, and right now I'm spoken for.

2.  It sounds intriguing, but I need to see the mayor, Jenni.

3. How about getting together later for a little one-on-one?

JENNI:
Darn it!
The good ones are always taken!

JENNI:
Well, if you ever change your mind, you know where to find me!

JENNI:
I'm only the receptionist, Blade.

JENNI:
You know I would get you in to see him if I could.

JENNI:
But, as I already told you, he's in an important meeting and cannot be disturbed.

JENNI:
There's some corporate bigwig from DH Enterprises here to bid for the city's water contracts or something.

JENNI:
Tell you what, Blade... come back later and I'll see what I can do for you, but I can't promise anything.

JENNI:
It sounds delicious, but I really wouldn't feel right about it unless you were to stop seeing that Karyn.

JENNI:
She is such a lame dame, Blade!  Maybe it's time for you to trade up!

JENNI:
Well, enough of this idle speculation...  You'd better run along now, Blade.  Ciao!

BLADE:
1. I'm flattered, Jenni, but I'm a one girl kind of guy and right now I'm spoken for.  Besides, I really need to talk with Karyn.

2. It sounds intriguing, but I really need to talk to Karyn.

3. Maybe we should take a little drive later...

JENNI:
Down in flames again!

JENNI:
See you later, Blade.

JENNI:
It sounds fabulous, but I don't think your girlfriend would approve.

JENNI:
You're quite a charmer, Blade, but you need to get your priorities straight and cut loose that ball and chain.

JENNI:
Come back and see me sometime, Hunter.

JENNI:
It sounds fabulous, darling...

JENNI:
But what about that Karyn Sommers person?  She definitely has to go!

JENNI:
Why don't you go dump her and give me a call on the rebound?

JENNI:
See you later, you big stud!

JENNI:
Sure, Blade.

JENNI:
Goodbye.

JENNI:
Hello, handsome! What can I do for you now?

BLADE:
1.  I'd like to get in to see the mayor, if it's possible.

2.  I need to see Karyn Sommers in the Bureau of Records.

3.  I kind of thought we might have some unfinished business to talk about.

JENNI:
No can do, Blade!  I'm sorry, but he's very busy right now.

JENNI:
Well, go see HER and quit bothering ME!

JENNI:
I may have given you the impression that I was interested in you before, Blade...

JENNI:
But I've changed my mind.  It's a woman's prerogative to do that, you know.

JENNI:
See you around, Blade.

JENNI:
Hello again, Blade. It's nice to see you!

JENNI:
I'm terribly sorry, Blade. But the mayor has left orders that he is not to be disturbed...
Especially by you.

JENNI:
If it were up to me, you could see anyone you want.  But the mayor is extremely busy right now.

JENNI:
Not much, Blade. The mayor is still busy, if that's why you're here.

JENNI:
Sorry, Blade, but I can't have you marching into the mayor's office every time you want your parking tickets fixed!

JENNI:
If you're pulling my leg this time, we're both gonna catch hell!

JENNI:
Mr. Mayor,  William Hunter's here to see you on an extremely urgent matter!

MAYOR:
He's not here to get me to fix some parking tickets, is he?

JENNI:
He claims it is urgent, sir.

JENNI:
He is threatening to reveal information which would hurt your chances to be re-elected.

MAYOR:
Very well.  Send him up.

JENNI:
There's no need to get upset.  I'm sure the mayor will see you when it is convenient for him.

JENNI:
Good day, Blade.

JENNI:
'Bye, Blade.

JENNI:
Hello, Blade. What can I do for you?

JENNI:
Make sure you show it to the guard.

JENNI:
Still wasting time with that chick, I see!

JENNI:
Very well.  Go on in.

JENNI:
Not again, Blade!

JENNI:
There is absolutely NO way the mayor is going to see you now, Blade!

JENNI:
Come back in a month or so.

JENNI:
You can't go in right now, Blade.  The mayor's in an important meeting!

JENNI:
Sorry, Blade.  The mayor can't see you now.

JENNI:
The mayor is unavailable at this time, Blade.

JENNI:
That's a secure area, Blade.  You can't get past the guard without a pass.

JENNI:
I wouldn't go in there if I were you, Blade!

JENNI:
Blade, you can't enter the security zone without the proper pass.

JENNI:
Don't bother me right now, Blade.  My nails are wet.

JENNI:
I'm sure you have more important things to do than harass me.  So beat it!

JENNI:
Come back later, Blade. I'm really busy!

Jenni, the City Hall receptionist, is, as usual, busily occupied with a laborious task of absolutely no importance.

I hope she doesn't try
to come on 
to me again!

To armory.

To mayor's chambers.

To Bureau of Records.

To street.

I already told ya!  No pass, no access!

DEPUTY VAN HALEN:
There ain't no way you're gettin' in here without a pass, buddy!

DEPUTY VAN HALEN:
That's no security pass!

DEPUTY VAN HALEN:
Sorry, buddy! Ya can't get past this checkpoint without the proper authorization.

BLADE:
I don't have one.

To lobby.

To police armory.

******************** S46.SDS ********************

The M1000X assault rifle.  Truly awesome firepower.

OOOHHH!!
AAAHHH!!

Really, really, restricted area!

Locked.

Empty storage cabinets.

It's probably not a good idea for me to be waving a gun around in here!

I could get in serious trouble if I pull my gun out in here!

A gun isn't going to do me any good here!

I better put that can of NaPent away while I'm here!

I don't think I should try to use NaPent on anything here!

NaPent isn't going to do me any good here!

To checkpoint.

******************** S47.SDS ********************

BLADE:
You're damn right it is!

BLADE:
And I'm sick and tired of being given the runaround by your people!

BLADE:
You're the effin' jerk who hired me for this gig, and then you act like I'm radioactive when I try to get in touch with you!

BLADE:
Yeah, and a lot of it's in this building!

BLADE:
1. A threat? I'm really scared.

2. I've had enough of this crap!  I'm leaving.

3. You should show a little more courtesy to someone who has information that could cost you the next election!

MAYOR:
Not so fast!  You have some information for me, I believe.

BLADE:
I have information which indicates your daughter may have been involved with a member of the Chinese Mafia.

BLADE:
And likely a drug addict to boot!

BLADE:
1. Well, you charmed it out of me.

2. Do your worst, Vinnie!

BLADE:
Chandi was hangin' 'round a China Mafioso name o' Chen Lu.  It seems he gave her some bad juice.

BLADE:
Bad with a capital 'B'!

BLADE:
It was laced with some exotic virus that scrambles your genes.  It's all on this tape.

BLADE:
I found what was left of him on the floor of his apartment.

BLADE:
Since he died the same way Chandi did, it seems likely that the Chinese Mafia is somehow involved with this M.T.Z.

BLADE:
You haven't done anything to tick them off lately, have you?

BLADE:
Somehow I'm not reassured.

BLADE:
And all I get for my trouble is a lotta flack from you.  How 'bout a little cooperation here?!

BLADE:
I don't like being left hung out to dry!

BLADE:
I don't think I like the way you phrased that.

To City Hall Lobby.

KARYN:
What in the hell are you doing here, Blade?!

KARYN:
I'm just great, you two-timing scum-sucking creep!

KARYN:
Here're your keys back, you bum!

KARYN:
Now get out of my office and out of my life!

KARYN:
Not interested.  You've screwed me over one too many times, William Hunter!

KARYN:
Here are your keys! Take them and get lost! I never want to see you again!

KARYN:
You must be missing a few chromosomes if you think I'll take you back this time!

KARYN:
Now here're your keys back, you turd!  Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out!

KARYN:
I said LEAVE!

KARYN:
GET OUT!

KARYN:
Drop dead, creep!

KARYN:
I had a really special time sitting at home watching Rambo 12 in my brand-new evening dress!

KARYN:
Where in the hell were you?!  Out drunk in one of those god-awful Pleasure Domes again?  You could have at least called!

KARYN:
You'd better have a darn good excuse for standing me up, Blade!

KARYN:
Not to me they don't, buster!

KARYN:
Why don't you think about this tonight as you sleep alone in that rat-trap you call an apartment!

KARYN:
Here are your lousy keys back, dirtbag!

KARYN:
Now buzz off and don't come back until you're prepared to behave yourself!

KARYN:
That's not much of an apology, but knowing you, it's probably as much as I could hope for!

KARYN:
Just make sure nothing like this happens again.

KARYN:
Now, Blade, what can I do for you?

KARYN:
I'll forgive you this time, Blade.

KARYN:
But don't make promises you can't keep!

BLADE:
You know I wouldn't miss a date without a good reason.

KARYN:
You'd just better watch yourself in the future, William Hunter!

KARYN:
A person can only stand so much.

KARYN:
Now, Blade,  I suppose you want me to run something for you, right?

KARYN:
Ha!  That'll be the day!

KARYN:
How about picking me up at 7:30 for dinner at L'Etoile?

KARYN:
Great!  It's a date then.

KARYN:
You techno-dweeb!  Blade, sometimes you have all the romance of a cybernetic trash-compactor.

KARYN:
Forget I mentioned it.

KARYN:
Now I'm sure you want me to run something for you, so let's get it over with.

KARYN:
Don't you try to "cupcake" me, mister!  I can read your line of bull a mile away.

KARYN:
Just don't screw up again, Blade.

KARYN:
I'm sure this visit has an ulterior motive, so just tell me what you want me to run for you and cut the crap.

BLADE:
But there is one little thing. Could you run some information through your computer for me?

KARYN:
You are possibly the most obnoxious man in this entire scum-ridden city!

BLADE:
So put a lid on it!!

KARYN:
It's men like you who keep marriage counselors in business.

KARYN:
Here're your keys back, jerk!

KARYN:
Now get out of here and don't show your face again until you've had a serious attitude adjustment!

KARYN:
Well...  Show a little consideration in the future.  It will get you a long way.

KARYN:
I'm sure this was more than just a courtesy call, so what is it that you want me to run for you?

KARYN:
Yeah, right.

KARYN:
Now I have a sneaking suspicion that you want me to make a computer run for you, right?

KARYN:
So let's get going with it.

BLADE:
I have some things I'd like you to take a look at for me, Karyn.

KARYN:
I'm afraid I don't recognize the script of the Chinese calligraphy.

KARYN:
It looks like an archaic dialect of Mandarin Chinese.

KARYN:
Why don't you take it to one of the old scholars down in Chinatown?

KARYN:
I'm sure someone will be able to decipher it.

KARYN:
I haven't any idea what this patch has been doped with, but I can have the lab boys analyze it for you.

KARYN:
It won't be ready until tomorrow, though.

BLADE:
That will be fine. I'll come and get the report when it's ready.

KARYN:
I've already seen that.  Do you want me to look at something else?

KARYN:
I don't see how I can help you with that.  Anything else you want me to check out?

KARYN:
I can't tell you anything you don't already know about that.  Is there something else?

KARYN:
Here are the keys you left with me, Blade.

BLADE:
Thanks, Karyn.

KARYN:
You're welcome, Blade.

KARYN:
Come back if you need me to make a computer run for you later.

KARYN:
Come back later if you need me to check out anything else for you.

KARYN:
See you later.

KARYN:
And don't you DARE forget our date tonight!

KARYN:
Go away, Blade.  I have a lot of work to do right now.

KARYN:
I've helped you as much as I can for now, Blade.  Goodbye.

KARYN:
I'm very busy at the moment.  Come back later if you have anything new for me.

KARYN:
Quit bothering me, Blade! I've got work of my own to get done.  Goodbye!

KARYN:
Flowers?... What flowers?

KARYN:
Well... Don't just stand there!  Give them to me!

KARYN:
Well, Blade, back again?

KARYN:
I don't see how I can do anything for you now.  Come back later when you have some information for me to run through the computer.

KARYN:
I've got to get back to work now. See you tonight, dear.

KARYN:
The only way I can help you is if you bring me some information to run through the computer.

KARYN:
Come back later. Goodbye, Blade... and don't forget our date!

KARYN:
I'm very busy right now.  Come back later if you have a specific question for me.

KARYN:
Goodbye for now, Blade.  See you tonight.

KARYN:
Oh, great! "Mr Congeniality" is back!  What the hell do you want now?!

KARYN:
Well, if that's the way you feel, why don't you get the hell out of my office, you bastard!

KARYN:
And don't bother coming back!  As far as I'm concerned, this relationship is finished!!

KARYN:
Apology accepted...

KARYN:
Now I have to get back to work, Blade.

KARYN:
Come back later if you want me to make a computer run for you.

KARYN:
Goodbye, Blade.

KARYN:
Well, don't you EVER pull that high and mighty crap with me again, buster!

KARYN:
Thanks for dropping by, but I have to get back to work.  You'd better go, Blade. I'll get in trouble if my boss sees us talking.

KARYN:
'Bye 'bye, Blade.

KARYN:
I don't see how I can do anything for you now.  Come back later when you have some information for me to run through the computer.

KARYN:
I've got to get back to work now. See you later.

KARYN:
The only way I can help you is if you bring me some information to run through the computer.

KARYN:
Come back later. Goodbye, Blade.

KARYN:
I'm very busy right now.  Come back later if you have a specific question for me.

KARYN:
Goodbye, Blade.

KARYN:
Well, Blade, it's nice to see you again.

KARYN:
I have that lab report you wanted.

KARYN:
Here is a tape of the lab results.  The techs said that was some pretty dangerous stuff.

KARYN:
You're obviously getting into something pretty heavy.

KARYN:
Please be careful, Blade.

KARYN:
No problem, loverboy. Here's the tape.

KARYN:
Watch your backside, Blade!  That's some pretty heavy stuff you've got there.

KARYN:
Here's a tape of the lab workup.  That stuff is pretty nasty! You'd better be careful, Blade.

KARYN:
Baloney!  You could get into a shoot-out in a Sunday school!  Just watch yourself!

KARYN:
They're really nice, Blade, but you're not out of the doghouse. You still owe me a night out.

KARYN:
How about picking me up at 7:30 for dinner at L'Etoile?

KARYN:
They're lovely, Blade, but you still owe me a night on the town for missing our date.

KARYN:
How about picking me up at 7:30 for dinner at L'Etoile?

She WOULD have to pick the most expensive joint in town... I was thinking of grabbing an Astro Burger and a beer!

KARYN:
You techno-dweeb!  Blade, sometimes you have all the romance of a cybernetic trash-compactor!

KARYN:
Forget I mentioned it.

KARYN:
Don't you try to "cupcake" me, mister!  I can read your line of bull a mile away!

KARYN:
Just don't screw up again.

KARYN:
Great! I'm looking forward to it.

KARYN:
Hi, Blade.  Nice to see you again.

KARYN:
Sorry, Blade. Check again later.

KARYN:
Nope.  It's not ready yet.  Try again later.

KARYN:
Not much, Will.  That lab report you wanted isn't ready yet, so you'll have to come back later.

KARYN:
Go away, Blade!  The city is facing a severe crisis, and I've got more important things to do than waste time with you!

KARYN:
Don't bother me now, Blade!  I'm trying to run down some information for the mayor's Special Operations Team.

KARYN:
They have priority override on all city data-links during this crisis.

KARYN:
If we don't figure out what's going on, millions of people are going to die.  So get out of here and let me do my work!

KARYN:
Dammit, Blade!  Not now!

KARYN:
There's panic in the streets, the mayor's having a conniption, and it's likely that we'll all be dead in a matter of days if we don't figure out what the hell to do!

KARYN:
So leave me alone and let me get back to work!  So long, Blade.

KARYN:
Here's the lab report you wanted, Blade...

KARYN:
Now go away!  The city is facing a severe crisis, and I've got more important things to do than waste time with you!

KARYN:
Is there anything you'd like me to look at?

KARYN:
I'll run this card through the computer and see what information the databank has on this character...

KARYN:
here it comes now...

KARYN:
I'm afraid I don't recognize the script of the Chinese calligraphy.

KARYN:
It looks like an archaic dialect of Mandarin Chinese.

KARYN:
Why don't you take it to one of the old scholars down in Chinatown?

KARYN:
I'm sure someone will be able to decipher it.

KARYN:
I haven't any idea what this patch has been doped with, but I can have the lab boys analyze it for you.

KARYN:
It won't be ready until tomorrow, though.

BLADE:
That'll be fine. I'll come and get the report when it's ready.

KARYN:
Is there anything else you'd like me to take a look at, Blade?

KARYN:
Come back if you need me to make another computer run for you later.

KARYN:
See you later, Blade.

KARYN:
And don't you DARE forget our date tonight!

KARYN:
Hmm.  This is very unusual...  There's a sleeper gate attached to this file.

KARYN:
If anyone tries to access the information contained inside the file, it will set off an alarm and wipe the system!

KARYN:
I can try to bypass it, but if it doesn't work, we could be in a very unhealthy situation!

KARYN:
Whatever you say, Blade.  I'd better get back to work, then.  Goodbye.

KARYN:
If you say so, Blade.  Here goes...

KARYN:
What little information there is in the computer on this guy is almost two years old.

KARYN:
No birth date, S.I.D. number, or address... Hell! There's not even a physical description of the guy!

KARYN:
His name appears in connection with some Fed investigations concerning the Chinese Mafia and a break-in at a military genetic research facility at Los Alamos.

KARYN:
In the course of this incident they killed 20 people and burned the place to the ground!

KARYN:
There's no mention of anything being stolen, and all other details are classified.

KARYN:
Now what the hell does the Chinese Mafia want with a genetic research facility?  Something very strange is going on here!

KARYN:
There's no way I can get any more information without tripping some heavy security, so I'm going to wipe all record of this trace.

KARYN:
Then I'm going to get back to work and pretend none of this happened.

KARYN:
You'd better get out of here, Blade.  I'll see you later.

KARYN:
Go away, Blade!  I have a lot of work to do right now.

KARYN:
I've helped you as much as I can for now, Blade.  Goodbye.

KARYN:
Haven't you got anything better to do than bother me?  Go away!

KARYN:
Get out of here and do something useful, Blade!  I'm very busy.

KARYN:
Well, Blade, back again?

KARYN:
Well, Blade, back again?

KARYN:
What the hell do you think you're doing with that?!

KARYN:
I'm no floozie you can just run up to and squirt in the face with joy juice!

KARYN:
Get that thing out of my face, Blade!  Don't try to be a macho jerk!

OFFICE WORKER:
Back off, buddy!  I'm not interested!

KARYN:
I've already seen that.

BLADE:
Hey beautiful, here's the stud of your life!

BLADE:
Oops, sorry, my mistake.

I'd better watch myself, or they'll start calling me "switchBlade"...

KARYN:
I can't believe you stood me up again, you creep!

KARYN:
Why doesn't that surprise me?

KARYN:
I don't know why, but I forgive you.

KARYN:
Wait, Blade! Take your keys before you go!

BLADE:
Can you run this tape for me again?

KARYN:
Sure, Blade! Let me load it up.

KARYN:
Oh Blade, it's beautiful! Thank you!

BLADE:
Uh.. Err...  Yeah, I knew you'd like it.

KARYN:
It's a book, Blade.  People used to read them a long time ago.

BLADE:
I know it's a book!  I was hoping you could tell me something about it.

KARYN:
What can I tell you, Blade?  Have you read it?  It looks like a kid's book.

KARYN:
Are you getting soft in the head, Blade?  It's just a fortune cookie.

BLADE:
What's the message mean?

KARYN:
I can't make any sense out of it.  It looks like some type of code.

OFFICE WORKER:
Just leave me alone, buddy!

Karyn Sommers, your sometime girlfriend, is hard at work here in the Bureau of Records.

It's probably not a good idea for me to be waving a gun around here!

I could get in serious trouble if I pull my gun out here!

A gun isn't going to do me any good here!

I'd better put that can of NaPent away while I'm on the street!

I don't think I should try to use NaPent on anything here!

NaPent isn't going to do me any good here!

WILLIAM HUNTER!!!  You good for nothing, four-flushing, dirty double dumbass!!!

KARYN:
I never want to see you again, you two-timing bastard!  And don't bother coming around anymore.  I'm having my locks changed!

It sure will be hard to crack this case with out Karyn's help... maybe even impossible.

Maybe you should restore a saved game...

THE JAKE:
Same thing that happened to Chandi...

THE JAKE:
HE was the one who got her mixed up in this crap!

THE JAKE:
Effin' drugger!

THE JAKE:
Maybe he pushed 'em enough that they just flatlined him.

THE JAKE:
That's the nicest thing you ever said to me...

THE JAKE:
Y'know, word on the street is that Chen got flatlined by some very big stiffs.

THE JAKE:
People are gettin' a little nervous...

THE JAKE:
Looks like somethin' very nasty's about to come down...

BLADE:
1. You ever heard of anything called M.T.Z.?

2. What's the word out about what happened to Chen?

3. Any idea who Chen was mixed up with?

THE JAKE:
M.T.Z.?! Where'd you hear about that?!

THE JAKE:
You wanna keep your distance from THAT pump, Hunter!

THE JAKE:
M.T.Z. is nuclear... as in meltdown! You sky once, maybe twice, and you don't come down... ever!

THE JAKE:
I hear, you so much as get a drop of it on your skin and you're hooked!

THE JAKE:
Some chiphead in the lab really did us a favor when he invented that stuff...

THE JAKE:
No word... people still talkin', though.

THE JAKE:
Seems someone else exited last night the same way, though...

THE JAKE:
someone other than Chen, that is.

THE JAKE:
I'll let you know if I hear anything more.

THE JAKE:
Now, I gotta go...

THE JAKE:
Nope. All's I know is that they're very big and mostly outta sight...

BLADE:
1. I got something I want you to look at.

2. Thanks for your help. You be around if I need you again?

3. My VidPhone number's in the chip. Give me a call, you hear anything else.

THE JAKE:
Nothin' new.

THE JAKE:
I find anything, I'll drop you a message on the Vid-Phone.

THE JAKE:
Hey! We're partners, aren't we? Slicker and the Kid....

THE JAKE:
You got it, Blade!

THE JAKE:
You mind if I call you Blade?

THE JAKE:
I just thought, since we're partners now and all... Slicker and the Kid Jake!

THE JAKE:
Sounds like a bad vidvision show, doesn't it?

BLADE:
1. Blade's fine.

2. Only my friends call me Blade.

3. Blade's my name... got no problem with you using it.

THE JAKE:
Alright. Blade it is.

THE JAKE:
Alright... well, I guess we're friends, then.

THE JAKE:
The Jake and a slicker... who would've thought?

THE JAKE:
Kinda strange nickname.

THE JAKE:
You'll have to tell me how you earned it sometime.

THE JAKE:
Anything else?

BLADE:
1. That's it.

2.  Yeah. What can you tell about this?

THE JAKE:
What the hell are you doin' with that?!

THE JAKE:
Didn't I tell you that this stuff is lethal?!!

THE JAKE:
Whatever you do, don't touch it to your skin!

THE JAKE:
You be doin' yourself a favor, you just flushed it!

THE JAKE:
That's an M.T.Z. drug patch!

THE JAKE:
What the hell are you doin' with this stuff?!!

THE JAKE:
It's major bad news... as in nuclear! You sky once or twice and you don't come down.... ever!!

THE JAKE:
I've heard that you can get hooked if just one DROP hits your skin!

THE JAKE:
You'd be doin' yourself a favor, you just flushed it!

THE JAKE:
Yeah... an I.D. card.

THE JAKE:
So what?

THE JAKE:
A gun clip?

THE JAKE:
Yeah. So?

THE JAKE:
Chocolate!

THE JAKE:
Where'd you get this?

THE JAKE:
Don't mind if I hang onto this, do ya?

THE JAKE:
Whoa! This explosive capsule part of your private dick crime fightin' gear?

THE JAKE:
Impressive hardware!

THE JAKE:
A wiretap system! I've used these... I mean... I've read about these.

THE JAKE:
More crime fightin' gear?

THE JAKE:
Physical trauma kit?

THE JAKE:
Bet you use this a lot!

THE JAKE:
A claim check!

THE JAKE:
So you plan on gettin' your stuff back when you leave, huh?

THE JAKE:
You must be one crafty slicker to get your gloves on one of these!

THE JAKE:
Those two monkeys aren't known for giving these out.

THE JAKE:
What the hell is this?

THE JAKE:
One of those tags that says, "Do not remove under penalty of law"?

THE JAKE:
Looks like Chinese or something.

THE JAKE:
Check with one of the tombstoners over in Chinatown.

THE JAKE:
Someone there might be able to read it.

THE JAKE:
Flowers?

THE JAKE:
Hey, we aren't THAT close, Blade!

THE JAKE:
You got a pissed girl or something?

THE JAKE:
Cripes! Where'd you get this?

THE JAKE:
Passcards to the Armory go for a pretty bit of credit on the streets.

THE JAKE:
You let me know, you decide to dump it!

THE JAKE:
Keys??

THE JAKE:
These supposed to hold some mystical meaning for me?

THE JAKE:
A vidtape?

THE JAKE:
I look like I could afford a player??

BLADE:
1. You heard anything more on Chen?

2. What's the word on the street?

3. Look, kid, you gotta keep callin' me slicker?

THE JAKE:
The street's been pretty quiet.

THE JAKE:
Word is, somethin's goin' down, but no one's talkin'.

THE JAKE:
I got a bad feelin', though...

THE JAKE:
This town don't hush up 'less somethin' real big's gearin' up.

THE JAKE:
Those tombstoners in Chinatown been screamin' and yammerin' 'bout that effin' demon of theirs.

THE JAKE:
Seems more patch jockeys 'been checkin' out like our buddy Chen.

THE JAKE:
People are scared...

THE JAKE:
somethin' big is goin' down!

THE JAKE:
No one's clued into exactly what... but somethin's goin' on!

THE JAKE:
Sorry... didn't mean nothin' by it.

THE JAKE:
There ain't been nothin' more 'bout our buddy Chen.

THE JAKE:
Wonder if he had anything to do with what's got the old Chinatowners all spooked.

BLADE:
1. Any word on the habits of these "patch jockeys?"

2. What're the old folks so worried about?

3. You don't seem to hold much of a liking for the folks in Chinatown.

BLADE:
1. These patch jockey M.T.Z. pumpers?

3. What're the old folks so worried about?

3. You don't seem to hold much of a liking for the folks in Chinatown.

THE JAKE:
Nothin' much, except they're all big-time pumpers.

THE JAKE:
I think they'd sell their mothers for another dose of brain gloss!

THE JAKE:
Don't know... word has it, though, that the M.T.Z. well's been runnin' pretty dry.

THE JAKE:
Gonna be a lotta' dry-mouthed streetwalkers!

THE JAKE:
They got themselves some ancient demon that's gonna come back and suck the life outta people.

THE JAKE:
You ask me, they been doin' too much opium!

THE JAKE:
Yeah... they kill your little sister and we'll see how much likin' you hold for 'em!

THE JAKE:
I gotta go...

THE JAKE:
keep in touch, slick.

BLADE:
1. I've got some stuff I'd like you to look at....

2. Alright... you be around if I need you?

3. You got any names of these "China tombstoners" of yours?

BLADE:
1. What do you know about an associate of Chen's named Jonny Qwong?

2. Alright... you be around if I need you?

3. You got any names of these "China tombstoners" of yours?

BLADE:
1. Ever heard Chen mention someone named Deng Hwang?

2. Alright... you be around if I need you?

3. You got any names of these "China tombstoners" of yours?

THE JAKE:
Let's see it.

THE JAKE:
Qwong?

THE JAKE:
Chen was messed up with Qwong?

THE JAKE:
This is not good news...

THE JAKE:
Qwong's a front man for some very bad uptowns.

THE JAKE:
This picture's beginnin' to look messy.

THE JAKE:

BLADE'S PISTOL:
With & Smesson Police Special pulse particle beam handgun.

A meticulousy maintained relic from Blade's past career as a peace officer.  This gun is extremely reliable but it lacks the firepower of many modern sidearms.

Greetings, William Hunter.

I am called Chang Li.

CHANG LI:
It is most gratifying to finally make your acquaintance.

BLADE:
How do you know who I am?

CHANG LI:
A man can learn a great many things if he knows how to listen.

CHANG LI:
Many things, William Hunter...

CHANG LI:
Those who wish you ill.

CHANG LI:
Celestial signs indicate a time of great change in this world, William Hunter!

CHANG LI:
The old order shall be destroyed, and the new shall take its place!

CHANG LI:
Please to stop asking so many silly questions and let me finish.

CHANG LI:
Yes, but that's only half of it.

CHANG LI:
You cannot escape your fate, William Hunter!

CHANG LI:
Not a great deal...

CHANG LI:
Process of elimination.

CHANG LI:
The minions of the Dark One have eliminated all my other candidates.

CHANG LI:
But please to let me offer my humble assistance to aid you.

CHANG LI:
Most interesting!  But humbly regret I cannot help with that.

CHANG LI:
Something else you wish me to examine?

CHANG LI:
Most unfortunate.

Hmmm...  Intriguing!

Target date: 3.8.5687

CHANG LI:
Not to interrupt, please.  I'm coming to it!

CHANG LI:
Not precisely. There is a prophecy foretelling his return:

CHANG LI:
"In the Age of Decay
"Marking the Dawn of Darkness
"The Dragon will arise...

CHANG LI:
"His evil shall become an addiction in
the soul of mankind, and death shall be
a blessing to those he has touched.

CHANG LI:
"Many will fear him.
"Many will fall before him.
"One will sacrifice all to destroy him."

CHANG LI:
If all women believed as you, it is unlikely that you would ever get a date!

Now I must render you what aid I can.

CHANG LI:
First:

Please to come back if I can be of any more assistance.

It is good to see you again, William Hunter!

JONNY QWONG:
You will either meet the production schedule or face the wrath of Bahumat!

Good news, Mr Qwong!  We've made up more than a day's worth of production in the last twenty-four hours!

JONNY QWONG:
WHAT??!

JONNY QWONG:
You pathetic fool!  That still leaves us almost six days behind schedule!

But we've already begun to exceed the safety margins!

JONNY QWONG:

JONNY QWONG:
Push the reactors to the redline!

JONNY QWONG:
There are many ways to die...

JONNY QWONG:
Some of which are more painful and drawn out than others.

JONNY QWONG:
I suggest you think about that.

I won't fail you again, Mr Qwong!

2.  Go ahead.

3.  I really wish you wouldn't do that.

RECEPTIONIST:
Nothing personal. It's standard operating procedure to call and verify these things.

RECEPTIONIST:
I'm sorry, sir.  There is no maintenance schedule listed for the microspoolers.  You'd better leave.

BLADE:
I was supposed to come by here last week, but I got tied up. I'm here today on my own time.

BLADE:
If you phone H.Q., it could cost me my job!

BLADE:
Tell you what.  You let me in there and then I'll take you out for dinner afterwards, miss...

LORAIN:
Call me Lorain, Louis.

LORAIN:
Dinner with you is a very appetizing offer, Louis!

LORAIN:
Go on in, I won't tell anyone you were late.   Most of the guards are on break now anyway.

LORAIN:
You're no repair man!

LORAIN:
I checked the VidPhone listings, and there is NO A10 Service Repair & Maintenance Company!

LORAIN:
I'm calling security!

LORAIN:
What?!!  How come nothing is happening?!

BLADE:
I disconnected the alarm system.

BLADE:
Sorry I had to torpedo you like that...

BLADE:
but your boss is up to no good, and if I don't stop him, a lot of people will get hurt!

BLADE:
You'd better get outta here! Things are gonna get nasty!

RECEPTIONIST:
Wait a minute...

RECEPTIONIST:
Do I know you from somewhere?

RECEPTIONIST:
You look really familiar.

RECEPTIONIST:
Wait a minute. Now I remember! You're Billy Hunter!

BLADE:
I haven't heard that name in a long time!

RECEPTIONIST:
Remember me? I'm Lorain Luttrell from Ridgemont.  We had several classes together.

BLADE:
1.  Of course I remember you!  I could never forget a face as pretty as yours!

2.  You've mistaken me for someone else.

3.  You look great! What'd'ya do?  Get a face-lift?  You used to be a dog in high school!

LORAIN:
You always were a charmer!

LORAIN:
How about getting together a little later for dinner and a drink or something?

BLADE:
1.  What do you mean, "or something"?

2.  Thanks, but no thanks.

3.  Sure!  We can talk about old times.

LORAIN:
It sounds like fun!

BLADE:
It sure does!

LORAIN:
Use your imagination.

BLADE:
Sounds like a good time!

LORAIN:
You're still a little stuck up, I see.

BLADE:
No, just self-confident.

BLADE:
Look, Lorain...

BLADE:
Do you think you could give me a few minutes alone in the security room?

LORAIN:
Are you kidding?  I'd lose my job for sure!  You'd better leave.

LORAIN:
Right NOW!

BLADE:
But first, I really need to get into the security room to check on something!

LORAIN:
I'm really not supposed to let anyone in there...

BLADE:
I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important!

BLADE:
There's a lot of dangerous business going down, and I think your boss may be involved somehow.

BLADE:
Besides, I won't tell anyone you let me in.

LORAIN:
I'm sure you wouldn't, but I can't afford to risk my job!

BLADE:
1.  Oh, come on!

2.  Pretty please?

3.  How 'bout if I throw in a movie with dinner?

LORAIN:
Sorry, William, I just can't!

LORAIN:
Now you'd better go. I could already be in trouble for talking to you this long!

LORAIN:
Well...  O.K. But make it quick!  Most of the guards are on break, but that won't last long.

LORAIN:
You were in there an awfully long time, William...

LORAIN:
Wait a minute! My security panel just went blank!

RECEPTIONIST:
That's too bad.

RECEPTIONIST:
Now, what can I do for you?

RECEPTIONIST:
Thanks, I think...?

Citizens of Los Angeles, this is the voice of Bahumat!

What I am is not important at the moment, but know this:  I will soon be in absolute control of this city!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
I have only two demands:

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
First,  Mayor Vincenzi must dismiss the entire police force and resign his office!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
Second,  500 million dollars in diamonds and platinum must be delivered to me in a time, place, and manner of my choice!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
If my demands are not agreed to in principle within the next ten hours, I will spread my considerable stocks of Dragon M.T.Z. among the city's population!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
Certain parts of the law enforcement community in this city are, I believe, already familiar with the action of this substance on the body of a normal person!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
Suffice it to say, M.T.Z. poisoning is an extremely unpleasant way to die!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
Consider this fair warning, Mr. Mayor. Do not attempt any tricks, or I will kill every living thing in the City and County of Los Angeles!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
I sincerely hope that will not be necessary.  I am, after all, a reasonable individual...

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
as long as my conditions are fulfilled!

THE VOICE OF BAHUMAT:
Long live Bahumat!
