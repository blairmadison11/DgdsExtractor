# DgdsExtractor
Extracts assets from DGDS game data

DGDS Extractor is a simple utility to extract uncompressed game assets from games designed with the Dynamix Game Development System. The current version of this program has only been tested on one game (Rise of the Dragon) but should only need minor modifications to work with other DGDS games.

This program heavily relies on the reverse engineering work done by Vasco Alexandre da Silva Costa through a partial implementation of DGDS engine in ScummVM. Most of the code for DGDS Extractor is original but a small portion has been adapted from Vasco's code in accordance with GNU GPLv3 license.
